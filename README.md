  <strong>Exploring consumer behavior through data-driven insights using K-Means Clustering</strong>
</p>

## 🔍 Project Overview

As part of our academic journey into Machine Learning, our team worked hands-on with **Unsupervised Learning** to uncover hidden patterns in consumer behavior. We implemented the <strong>K-Means Clustering</strong> algorithm on a real-world shopping mall dataset to segment customers based on their income and spending behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Segment customers based on their **Annual Income** and **Spending Score** to generate actionable business insights for targeted marketing and personalized services.

---

## 💻 Technologies & Libraries Used

<p>
  <code>Python</code> · <code>Pandas</code> · <code>Matplotlib</code> · <code>Seaborn</code> · <code>Scikit-learn</code>
</p>

---

## 📂 Dataset

We used the <strong>Mall_Customers.csv</strong> dataset, which contains demographic and behavioral data of mall visitors — including age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

By focusing on **Annual Income** and **Spending Score**, we uncovered valuable customer segments through unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means Clustering.

## 🧠 Approach & Highlights

<ul>
  <li>🔹 Preprocessed and explored the dataset visually and statistically</li>
  <li>🔹 Applied K-Means Clustering to group customers into segments</li>
  <li>🔹 Determined the optimal number of clusters using the <strong>Silhouette Score</strong></li>
  <li>🔹 Visualized clear clusters to interpret distinct consumer profiles</li>
</ul>

---

## 📈 Key Findings

The clustering revealed distinct customer groups, including:

<ul>
  <li>✅ High-income, high-spending customers</li>
  <li>✅ Low-income, low-spending customers</li>
  <li>✅ Moderate-income, moderate-spending groups</li>
  <li>✅ Segments with untapped spending potential</li>
</ul>

## 💡 Impact

This project demonstrated how <strong>unsupervised learning</strong> empowers businesses to:

<ul>
  <li>🔸 Identify and understand customer segments</li>
  <li>🔸 Optimize marketing strategies</li>
  <li>🔸 Improve customer engagement and personalization</li>
</ul>
